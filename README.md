# ELEVATOR-PROJECT

Using "NUCLEO -F401RE" board based on STM32 microcontroller which is based on ARM-Cortex processor, and "Free RTOS".

I developed software to control an elevator by:

1-)receiving the required floors from different users.
2-)calculate the next floor it should go to.
3-)interact with the users via an LCD screen.
